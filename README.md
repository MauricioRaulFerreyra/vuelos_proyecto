# Project
#### Project called "deviaje.com" in which I worked on the back-end side. It tries to consume information from an external API to create a single page application that allows the user to compare prices of different flight itineraries and purchase tickets. Being my first teamwork experience, I learned about using different branches within GitHub to create specific features before introducing them to the final project. I was also in charge of deploying the back-end and the database. 
## ðŸ›  Skills 
#### Node.js, Express, Sequelize, PostgrSQL.
